# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns a new array of the same numbers without any duplicates.

# Option 1 - time complexity
# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and prints each number
# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns them as a hash with a value of "true"
# Write a function that takes in a hash and prints all of the keys

# Option 2 - space somethingsomething
# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and prints each number


# ------------------

# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the largest product of any two numbers in the array.

# Example input: [5, 100, 25, 4, 32, 9]
# Expected output: 3200

# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and prints each number 
# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and loops through them to find and print the highest number
# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and loops through them to find and print the 2 highest numbers
#   possible substep: write a function that takes in an array of numbers and deletes the first 2 numbers in the array
#   Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and deletes the largest number
# Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and calculates the product of the 2 highest numbers
